## Features That Can Be Added

- The application currently operates using an in-memory repository. To transition to a more modern management system, databases like SQLite or MSSQL can be utilized.

- Additionally, if a database is used for the application, the code-first approach can be implemented. For this, EntityFrameworkCore packages can be integrated into the application, and the necessary connections should be configured.

- Finally, to improve code readability, comments can be added. Additionally, the user interface can be made more modern.
