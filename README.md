# Book App

This project is the first assignment in the ".NET Core Developer Dive Bootcamp" training organized by Techcareer.

## Overview of the Project

<b>User Interface: </b></br>
With a responsive, modern, and clear design, users can easily grasp the basic concept of the application. Additionally, the filtering and search functions allow users to interact with the application.

<b>Admin Management Action:</b></br>
In the admin management section, the admin can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for users, enabling efficient management of the application.

## Technologies, Tools, and Approaches Used

- <b>Asp.Net Core</b> : It formed the basic framework of the application.
- <b>Html - Css - Bootstrap 5 </b> : It provided a more modern and simplified development in the View sections of the application. Additionally, it ensured a responsive design for users

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- <b>.Net Core (version 7.0 or higher)</b>

### Setting up the Project

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the desired directory, and run: `git clone https://github.com/BartugKaan/BookApp`

### Run the Application

Use the following command to build and run the application: `dotnet run`

## Features That Can Be Added

- The application currently operates using an in-memory repository. To transition to a more modern management system, databases like SQLite or MSSQL can be utilized.

- Additionally, if a database is used for the application, the code-first approach can be implemented. For this, EntityFrameworkCore packages can be integrated into the application, and the necessary connections should be configured.

- Finally, to improve code readability, comments can be added. Additionally, the user interface can be made more modern.
